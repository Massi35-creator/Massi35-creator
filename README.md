Hello everybody! 👋  

I’ve just started my journey to become a developer.  
I am currently studying at Howest in Bruges, Belgium.  

I’ve always been interested in coding, but never really took the step to learn it—until now.  
These are my very first steps, and I just wanted to introduce myself this way. :)


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my first repository.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with Github and the infrastucture of it.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my first coding experience
- 💬 Ask me about anything
- 📫 How to reach me: can we communicate true Github? Idon't know 😅
- ⚡ Fun fact: 👉 Breaking things first, fixing them later — that’s how I learn.
