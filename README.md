Hello everybody! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™ve just started my journey to become a developer.  
I am currently studying at Howest in Bruges, Belgium.  

Iâ€™ve always been interested in coding, but never really took the step to learn itâ€”until now.  
These are my very first steps, and I just wanted to introduce myself this way. :)

<!--
**Massi35-creator/Massi35-creator** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first repository.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with Github and the infrastucture of it.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my first coding experience
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: can we communicate true Github? Idon't know ðŸ˜…
- âš¡ Fun fact: ðŸ‘‰ Breaking things first, fixing them later â€” thatâ€™s how I learn.
